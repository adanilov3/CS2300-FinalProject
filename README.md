# FinalProject-adanilov-bmbowman
### Brian Bowman and Sasha Danilov

### Summary
For our final project we created a ski mountain with working ski lifts and a skiier that flies down the mountain!
The user can click on different portions of the mountain to make the skiier go down that area of the screen.

### Concepts Used
Our project was centered around using graphics (Module 4) and various concepts within graphics such as timers, cursor
and mouse input, and integration with C++ classes. Additionally, we created shapes using polymorphism (Module 2), with a 
shape parent class and rect + circle child classes, and used those classes to draw most of the shapes in the window. 

### OS(s) Required
This program can be run from MacOS or Windows. In order to run this program, depending on your machine you must 
configure freeglut in the cmake-build-debug folder.

### Added Installation Necessary
None.

### Citations
We used the Graphics Starter code as the foundation for our project, and some of the code from Graphics Jeopardy
when making our classes.

### Known Bugs
A known bug that has occurred is that the lifts that were meant to only go up stray off to the side after going up the
lift line successfully.

### Expected Grade
We expect to get around 100 points on this project. The design of the program meets all requirements and includes
concepts from at least 2 of the 3 modules. The project is
easily as complex as the previous open-ended projects. The program is very user-friendly and doesn't have any
complicated instructions, and we put more effort into this project than any of the open-ended ones.
